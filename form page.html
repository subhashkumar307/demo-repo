            <h2>Terms of Condation</h2>
            <p>Depending on how you obtained the Windows software, this is a license agreement 
               between (i) you and the device manufacturer or software installer that distribute
               the software with your device; or (ii) you and Microsoft Corporation (or, based on
               where you live or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located, 
               one of its affiliates) if you acquired the software from a retailer. Microsoft is the 
               device manufacturer for devices produced by Microsoft or one of its affiliates, and 
               Microsoft is the retailer if you acquired the software directly from Microsoft. 
               Note that if you are a volume license customer, use of this software is subject to 
               your volume license agreement rather than this agreement.
