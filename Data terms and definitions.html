            <dd> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and 
                its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, 
                a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.
                 HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted
                  into a file intended for display on the Internet. The markup tells web browsers
                   how to display a web page's words and images.

                   JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side 
                   and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and 
                   CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives 
                   web pages interactive elements that engage a user.
                   JavaScript isn't exactly hard to learn, but if it's your first programming language 
                   adjusting to the mindset required for programming can take a lot of time. 
                   JavaScript is actually one of the easier programming languages to start with.

                CSS is the acronym of “Cascading Style Sheets”. CSS is a computer language for laying 
                out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML). This language contains coding elements 
                and is composed of these “cascading style sheets” which are equally called CSS files.
                CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, 
                layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, 
                such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML 
                and can be used with any XML-based markup language.
