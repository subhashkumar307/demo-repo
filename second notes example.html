 Depending on how you obtained the Windows
software, this is a license agreement between (i) you
and the device manufacturer or software installer that
distributes the software with your device; or (ii) you
and Microsoft Corporation (or, based on where you
live or, if a business, where your principal place of
business is located, one of its affiliates) if you acquired
the software from a retailer. Microsoft is the device
manufacturer for devices produced by Microsoft or
one of its affiliates, and Microsoft is the retailer if you
acquired the software directly from Microsoft. Note
that if you are a volume license customer, use of this 
software is subject to your volume license agreement
rather than this agreement.
 This agreement describes your rights and the
conditions upon which you may use the Windows
software. You should review the entire agreement,
including any supplemental license terms that
accompany the software and any linked terms,
because all of the terms are important and together
create this agreement that applies to you. You can
review linked terms by pasting the (aka.ms/) link into a
browser window.
