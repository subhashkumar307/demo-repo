        <p><b>CSS</b> is used to control the style of a web document in a simple and easy way.</p>
        <p><b>CSS</b> is the acronym for <b>"Cascading Style Sheet"</b>. This tutorial covers both the versions 
            CSS1,CSS2 and CSS3, and gives a complete understanding of CSS, starting from its basics 
            to advanced concepts.
        </p>
        <h3>Why to Learn CSS?</h3>
        <p><b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended 
            to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
        </p>
        <p>CSS is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer 
            specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the 
            key advantages of learning CSS:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Create Stunning Web site</b>
                     -  CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control 
                     the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how 
                     columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout 
                     designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a 
                     variety of other effects.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Become a web designer</b>
                     -  If you want to start a carrer as a professional web designer, HTML and CSS designing is a must skill.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Control web </b>
                     -  CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the 
                     presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup 
                     languages HTML or XHTML.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Learn other languages</b>
                     -  Once you understands the basic of HTML and CSS then other related technologies 
                     like javascript, php, or angular are become easier to understand.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Applications of CSS</h3>
        <p>As mentioned before, CSS is one of the most widely used style language over the web. 
            I'm going to list few of them here:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>CSS saves time</b>
                     -  You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages. 
                     You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages 
                     as you want.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Pages load faster</b>
                     -   If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. 
                     Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. 
                     So less code means faster download times.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Easy maintenance</b>
                     -  To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web 
                     pages will be updated automatically.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Superior styles to HTML</b>
                     -   CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better 
                     look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Multiple Device Compatibility</b>
                     - Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device. 
                     By using the same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented 
                     for handheld devices such as PDAs and cell phones or for printing.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Global web standards</b>
                     -  Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. 
                     So its a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible 
                     to future browsers.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Who Creates and Maintains CSS?</h3>
        <p>CSS is created and maintained through a group of people within the W3C called the CSS 
            Working Group. The CSS Working Group creates documents called specifications. When a 
            specification has been discussed and officially ratified by the W3C members, it becomes 
            a recommendation.
        </p>
        <p>These ratified specifications are called recommendations because the W3C has no control over 
            the actual implementation of the language. Independent companies and organizations create 
            that software.
        </p>
        <p><b>NOTE</b> − The World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C is a group that makes recommendations about 
            how the Internet works and how it should evolve.
        </p>
        <h3>CSS Versions</h3>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets level 1 (CSS1) came out of W3C as a recommendation in December 1996. 
            This version describes the CSS language as well as a simple visual formatting model for all 
            the HTML tags.
        </p>
        <p>CSS2 became a W3C recommendation in May 1998 and builds on CSS1. This version adds support 
            for media-specific style sheets e.g. printers and aural devices, downloadable fonts, 
            element positioning and tables.
        </p>
        <h3>CSS - Syntax</h3>
        <p>A CSS comprises of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the 
            corresponding elements in your document. A style rule is made of three parts −
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Selector</b>
                     -  A selector is an HTML tag at which a style will be applied. This could be any 
                     tag like  or  etc.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Property </b>
                     -  A property is a type of attribute of HTML tag. Put simply, all the HTML 
                     attributes are converted into CSS properties. They could be color, border etc.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Value</b>
                     -  Values are assigned to properties. For example, color property can have value either red or #F1F1F1 etc.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can put CSS Style Rule Syntax as follows −</p>
        <img src="/Images/css img.png" width="100%"><br>
        <br>
        <p><b>Example</b> − You can define a table border as follows −</p>
        <p>Here table is a selector and border is a property and given value 1px solid #C00 is the value of that property.</p>
        <p>You can define selectors in various simple ways based on your comfort. Let me put these selectors one by one.</p>
        <h3>The Type Selectors</h3>
        <p>This is the same selector we have seen above. Again, one more example to give a color to all level 1 headings −</p>
        <h3>The Universal Selectors</h3>
        <p>Rather than selecting elements of a specific type, the universal selector quite simply matches the name of any element type −</p>
        <p>This rule renders the content of every element in our document in black.</p>
        <h3>The Descendant Selectors</h3>
        <p>Suppose you want to apply a style rule to a particular element only when it lies inside a 
            particular element. As given in the following example, style rule will apply to <em> element 
            only when it lies inside <ul> tag.
        </p>
        <h3>The Class Selectors</h3>
        <p>You can define style rules based on the class attribute of the elements. All the elements having that class 
            will be formatted according to the defined rule.
        </p>
        <h3>The ID Selectors</h3>
        <p>You can define style rules based on the id attribute of the elements. All the elements 
            having that id will be formatted according to the defined rule.
        </p>
        <h3>The Child Selectors</h3>
        <p>You have seen the descendant selectors. There is one more type of selector, which is very 
            similar to descendants but have different functionality. Consider the following example −
        </p>
        <h3>The Attribute Selectors</h3>
        <p>You can also apply styles to HTML elements with particular attributes. The style rule below 
            will match all the input elements having a type attribute with a value of text −
        </p>
        <p>The advantage to this method is that the <input type = "submit" /> element is unaffected, 
            and the color applied only to the desired text fields.
        </p>
        <p>There are following rules applied to attribute selector.</p>
        <ul class="list">

        <h3>Multiple Style Rules</h3>
        <p>You may need to define multiple style rules for a single element. You can define these 
            rules to combine multiple properties and corresponding values into a single block as 
            defined in the following example −
        </p>
        <img src="/Images/css img1.png" width="100%">
        <p>Here all the property and value pairs are separated by a semicolon (;). You can keep them in 
            a single line or multiple lines. For better readability, we keep them in separate lines.
        </p>
        <p>For a while, don't bother about the properties mentioned in the above block. These properties 
            will be explained in the coming chapters and you can find complete detail about properties 
            in CSS References.
        </p>
        <h3>Grouping Selectors</h3>
        <p>You can apply a style to many selectors if you like. Just separate the selectors with a 
            comma, as given in the following example −
        </p>
        <img src="/Images/css img2.png" width="100%">
        <p>This define style rule will be applicable to h1, h2 and h3 element as well. The order of the 
            list is irrelevant. All the elements in the selector will have the corresponding declarations 
            applied to them.
        </p>
        <p>You can combine the various id selectors together as shown below −</p>
        <img src="/Images/css img3.png" width="100%">
    </div>
</body>
</html>
