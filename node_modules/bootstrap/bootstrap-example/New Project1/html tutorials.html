        <p><b>HTML</b> stands for <b>Hyper Text Markup Language,</b> which is the most widely used language on 
            Web to develop web pages. <b>HTML</b> was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was 
            the first standard HTML specification which was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major 
            version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used 
            but currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this 
            version was published in 2012.
        </p>
        <h3>Why to learn to HTML?</h3>
        <p>Originally,<b> HTML</b> was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like       
            headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information 
            between researchers. Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of 
            different tags available in HTML language.
        </p>
        <p><b>HTML</b> is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer

        <h3>HTML - Overview</h3>
        <p>HTML stands for <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b>, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages.</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                <p><b>Hypertext</b> refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. 
                    Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>As its name suggests, HTML is a <b>Markup Language</b> which means you use HTML to 
                    simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to 
                    structure it to display.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents 
            like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific 
            information between researchers.
        </p>
        <p>Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags 
            available in HTML language.
        </p>
        <h3>HTML Tags</h3>
        <p>As told earlier, HTML is a markup language and makes use of various tags to format the 
            content. These tags are enclosed within angle braces <b><Tag Name></b>. Except few tags, most 
            of the tags have their corresponding closing tags. For example, <b><html></b> has its 
            closing tag <b></html></b> and <b><body></b> tag has its closing tag <b></body></b> tag etc.
        </p>
        <p>Above example of HTML document uses the following tags − </p>
        <table class="table table-bordered">
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>Sr .No</th>
                    <th style="text-align: center;">Tag & Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="ts">1</td>
                    <td>
                        <b></b>DOCTYPE....</b>
                        <P>This tag defines the document type and HTML version.</P>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="ts">2</td>
                    <td>
                        <b> html </b>
                        <P>This tag encloses the complete HTML document and mainly comprises of document 
                            header which is represented by document body which is 
                            represented by  tags.
                        </P>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="ts">3</td>
                    <td>
                        <b><head></b>
                        <P>This tag represents the document's header which can keep other HTML tags like etc.
                        </P>
                    </td>
                </tr>
               

                <tr>
                    <td class="ts">4</td>
                    <td>
                        <b> title</b>
                        <P>The tag is used inside the tag to mention the document title.</P>
                    </td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td class="ts">5</td>
                    <td>
                        <b>body</b>
                        <P>This tag represents the document's body which keeps other HTML tags like etc.</P>
                    </td>
                </tr>

        </table>
        <p>To learn HTML, you will need to study various tags and understand how they behave, while 
            formatting a textual document. Learning HTML is simple as users have to learn the usage of 
            different tags in order to format the text or images to make a beautiful webpage.
        </p>
        <p>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends to use lowercase tags starting from HTML 4.</p>
        <h3>HTML Document Structure</h3>
        <p>A typical HTML document will have the following structure −</p>
        <pre class="prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted">
            <span class="tag">&lt;html&gt;</span>
            <span class="pln"></span>
            <span class="tag">&lt;head&gt;</span>
            <span class="pln">Document header related tags</span>
            <span class="tag">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
            <span class="pln"> </span>
            <span class="tag">&lt;body&gt;</span>
            <span class="pln">Document body related tags</span>
            <span class="tag">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
            <span class="pln"></span>
            <span class="tag">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
       </pre>
       <p>We will study all the header and body tags in subsequent chapters, but for now let's see what 
           is document declaration tag.
        </p>
        <h3>The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; Declaration</h3>
        <p>The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration tag is used by the web browser to understand the version of the 
            HTML used in the document. Current version of HTML is 5 and it makes use of 
            the following declaration −
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted">
            <span class="dec">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
        </pre>
        <p>There are many other declaration types which can be used in HTML document depending on what 
            version of HTML is being used. We will see more details on this while 
            discussing &lt;!DOCTYPE...&gt; tag along with other HTML tags.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">HTML - Basic Tags</h3>
        <h3>Heading Tags</h3>
        <p>Any document starts with a heading. You can use different sizes for your headings. HTML also 
            has six levels of headings, which use the 
            elements <b>&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;,</b> and <b>&lt;h6&gt;</b>. 
            While displaying any heading, browser adds one line before and one line after that heading.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <div class="demo-view">
            <a href="http://tpcg.io/Oevfe8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>
        </div>
        <pre class="prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted">
            <span class="dec">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span><span class="pln"></span>
            <span class="tag">&lt;html&gt;</span><span class="pln"></span>
            <span class="tag">&lt;head&gt;</span><span class="pln"> </span>
            <span class="tag">&lt;title&gt;</span>
            <span class="pln">Paragraph Example</span>
            <span class="tag">&lt;/title&gt;</span><span class="pln"></span>
            <span class="tag">&lt;/head&gt;</span><span class="pln"></span>

        <h3>Paragraph Tag</h3>
        <p>The &lt;br /&gt; tag has a space between the characters <b>br</b> and the forward slash. If you 
            omit this space, older browsers will have trouble rendering the line break, while if you miss 
            the forward slash character and just use &lt;br&gt; it is not valid in XHTML.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <div class="demo-view">
            <a href="http://tpcg.io/aWg5PG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>

        <h3>Line Break Tag</h3>
        <p>Whenever you use the <b>&lt;br /&gt;</b> element, anything following it starts from the next 
            line. This tag is an example of an <b>empty</b> element, where you do not need opening and 
            closing tags, as there is nothing to go in between them.
        </p>
        <p>The &lt;br /&gt; tag has a space between the characters <b>br</b> and the forward slash. If you 
            omit this space, older browsers will have trouble rendering the line break, while if you miss 
            the forward slash character and just use &lt;br&gt; it is not valid in XHTML.
        </p>
        <h3>Horizontal Lines</h3>
        <p>Horizontal lines are used to visually break-up sections of a document. The <b>&lt;hr&gt;</b> tag 
            creates a line from the current position in the document to the right margin and breaks the 
            line accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>Again <b>&lt;hr /&gt;</b> tag is an example of the <b>empty</b> element, where you do not need 
            opening and closing tags, as there is nothing to go in between them.
        </p>
        <p>The <b>&lt;hr /&gt;</b> element has a space between the characters <b>hr</b> and the forward slash. 
            If you omit this space, older browsers will have trouble rendering the horizontal line, while if 
            you miss the forward slash character and just use <b>&lt;hr&gt;</b> it is not valid in XHTML
        </p>
        <h3>Preserve Formatting</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, you want your text to follow the exact format of how it is written in the HTML document. 
            In these cases, you can use the preformatted tag <b>&lt;pre&gt;</b>.
        </p>
        <p>Any text between the opening <b>&lt;pre&gt;</b> tag and the closing <b>&lt;/pre&gt;</b> tag will 
            preserve the formatting of the source document.
        </p>
        <h3>Nonbreaking Spaces</h3>
        <p>Suppose you want to use the phrase "12 Angry Men." Here, you would not want a browser to split 
            the "12, Angry" and "Men" across two lines −
        </p>
        <pre class="result notranslate">An example of this technique appears in the movie "12 Angry Men."
        </pre>
        <p>In cases, where you do not want the client browser to break text, you should use a nonbreaking 
            space entity <b>&amp;nbsp;</b> instead of a normal space. For example, when coding 
            the "12 Angry Men" in a paragraph, you should use something similar to the following code −
        </p>

       <h3 style="text-align: center;">HTML - Elements</h3>
       <p>An <b>HTML element</b> is defined by a starting tag. If the element contains other content, it ends with 
           a closing tag, where the element name is preceded by a forward slash as shown below with few tags −
        </p>
        <table class="table table-bordered">
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                   <th style="text-align:center;">Start Tag</th>
                   <th style="text-align:center;">Content</th>
                   <th style="text-align:center;">End Tag</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>&lt;p&gt;</td>
                    <td>This is paragraph content.</td>
                    <td>&lt;/p&gt;</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>&lt;h1&gt;</td>
                    <td>This is heading content.</td>
                    <td>&lt;/h1&gt;</td>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                    <td>&lt;div&gt;</td>
                    <td>This is division content.</td>
                    <td>&lt;/div&gt;</td>
               </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>&lt;br /&gt;</td>
                    <td></td>
                    <td></td>
               </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>So here <b>&lt;p&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;</b> is an HTML element, <b>&lt;h1&gt;...&lt;/h1&gt;</b> is another 
            HTML element. There are some HTML elements which don't need to be closed, 
            such as <b>&lt;img.../&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;hr /&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;br /&gt;</b> elements. 
            These are known as <b>void elements</b>.
        </p>
        <p>HTML documents consists of a tree of these elements and they specify how HTML documents should be 
            built, and what kind of content should be placed in what part of an HTML document.
        </p>
        <h3>HTML Tag vs. Element</h3>
        <p>An HTML element is defined by a <i>starting tag</i>. If the element contains other content, it 
            ends with a <i>closing tag</i>.
        </p>
        <p>For example, <b>&lt;p&gt;</b> is starting tag of a paragraph and <b>&lt;/p&gt;</b> is closing tag 
            of the same paragraph but <b>&lt;p&gt;This is paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</b> is a paragraph element.
        </p>
        <h3>Nested HTML Elements</h3>
        <p>It is very much allowed to keep one HTML element inside another HTML element −</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
