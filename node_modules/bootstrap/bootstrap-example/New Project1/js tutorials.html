        <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating 
            network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is 
            very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.
        </p>
        <h3>Why to Learn Javascript</h3>
        <p><b>Javascript</b> is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer 
            specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key 
            advantages of learning Javascript:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                <p>Javascript is the most popular <b>programming language</b> in the world and that makes it 
                    a programmer’s great choice. Once you learnt Javascript, it helps you developing great 
                    front-end as well as back-end softwares using different Javascript based frameworks 
                    like jQuery, Node.JS etc.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Javascript is everywhere, it comes installed on every modern web browser and so to 
                    learn Javascript you really do not need any special environment setup. For example Chrome, 
                    Mozilla Firefox , Safari and every browser you know as of today, supports Javascript.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Javascript helps you create really beautiful and crazy fast websites. You can develop 
                    your website with a console like look and feel and give your users the best Graphical 
                    User Experience.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>JavaScript usage has now extended to mobile app development, desktop app development,
                    and game development. This opens many opportunities for you as Javascript Programmer.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Due to high demand, there is tons of job growth and high pay for those who know JavaScript.
                    You can navigate over to different job sites to see what having JavaScript skills looks 
                    like in the job market.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Great thing about Javascript is that you will find tons of frameworks and Libraries already 
                    developed which can be used directly in your software development to reduce your time 
                    to market.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There could be 1000s of good reasons to learn Javascript Programming. But one thing for sure, 
            to learn any programming language, not only Javascript, you just need to code, and code and 
            finally code until you become expert.
        </p>
        <p>There are many useful <b>Javascript frameworks</b> and libraries available:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                <p>Angular</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>React</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>jQuery</p>
            </li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is really impossible to give a complete list of all the available Javascript frameworks 
            and libraries. The Javascript world is just too large and too much new is happening.
        </p>
        <h3>Applications of Javascript Programming</h3>
        <p>As mentioned before, Javascript is one of the most widely used programming languages 
            (Front-end as well as Back-end). It has it's presence in almost every area of software 
            development. I'm going to list few of them here:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Client side validation </b>
                    - This is really important to verify any user input before submitting it to the server 
                    and Javascript plays an important role in validting those inputs at front-end itself.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Manipulating HTML Pages </b>
                    - Javascript helps in manipulating HTML page on the fly. This helps in adding and deleting 
                    any HTML tag very easily using javascript and modify your HTML to change its look and feel 
                    based on different devices and requirements.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>User Notifications </b>
                    - You can use Javascript to raise dynamic pop-ups on the webpages to give different types 
                    of notifications to your website visitors.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Back-end Data Loading </b>
                    - Javascript provides Ajax library which helps in loading back-end data while you are 
                    doing some other processing. This really gives an amazing experience to your website visitors.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Presentations </b>
                    - JavaScript also provides the facility of creating presentations which gives website 
                    look and feel. JavaScript provides RevealJS and BespokeJS libraries to build a web-based 
                    slide presentations.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Server Applications </b>
                    - Node JS is built on Chrome's Javascript runtime for building fast and scalable 
                    network applications. This is an event based library which helps in developing very 
                    sophisticated server applications including Web Servers.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This list goes on, there are various areas where millions of software developers are happily 
            using Javascript to develop great websites and others softwares.
        </p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>This tutorial has been prepared for JavaScript beginners to help them understand the 
            basic functionality of JavaScript to build dynamic web pages and web applications.
        </p>
        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
        <p>For this Javascript tutorial, it is assumed that the reader have a prior knowledge of HTML coding. 
            It would help if the reader had some prior exposure to object-oriented programming concepts and a 
            general idea on creating online applications.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">JavaScript - Overview</h3>
        <h3>What is JavaScript ?</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as 
            a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and 
            make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript was first known as <b>LiveScript</b>, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly 
            because of the excitement being generated by Java. <b>JavaScript</b> made its first appearance in 
            Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has 
            been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.
        </p>
        <p>The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Designed for creating network-centric applications.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Complementary to and integrated with Java.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Complementary to and integrated with HTML.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Open and cross-platform</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Client-Side JavaScript</h3>
        <p>Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in 
            or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.
        </p>
        <p>It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact 
            with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.
        </p>
        <p>The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side 
            scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail 
            address in a form field.
        </p>
        <p>The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries 
            are valid, they would be submitted to the Web Server.
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, 
            and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly.
        </p>
        <h3>Advantages of JavaScript</h3>
        <p>The merits of using JavaScript are −</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Less server interaction</b>
                    - You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server
                     traffic, which means less load on your server.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b> Immediate feedback to the visitors</b>
                    - They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b> Increased interactivity</b>
                    - You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or 
                    activates them via the keyboard.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Richer interfaces </b>
                    - You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders 
                    to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Limitations of JavaScript</h3>
        <p>We cannot treat JavaScript as a full-fledged programming language. It lacks the following 
            important features −
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                <p>Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been 
                    kept for security reason.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such 
                    support available.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>JavaScript doesn't have any multi-threading or multiprocessor capabilities. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once again, JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that allows you to 
            build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages.
        </p>
        <h3>JavaScript Development Tools</h3>
        <p>One of major strengths of JavaScript is that it does not require expensive development tools.
            You can start with a simple text editor such as Notepad. Since it is an interpreted language 
            inside the context of a web browser, you don't even need to buy a compiler.
        </p>
        <p>To make our life simpler, various vendors have come up with very nice JavaScript editing tools. 
            Some of them are listed here −
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Microsoft FrontPage</b>
                    - Microsoft has developed a popular HTML editor called FrontPage. FrontPage also provides 
                    web developers with a number of JavaScript tools to assist in the creation of interactive 
                    websites.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Macromedia Dreamweaver MX </b>
                    - Macromedia Dreamweaver MX is a very popular HTML and JavaScript editor in the professional 
                    web development crowd. It provides several handy prebuilt JavaScript components,

                </p>
            </li>

        <h3>Where is JavaScript Today ?</h3>
        <p>The ECMAScript Edition 5 standard will be the first update to be released in over four years. 
            JavaScript 2.0 conforms to Edition 5 of the ECMAScript standard, and the difference between 
            the two is extremely minor.
        </p>
        <p>The specification for JavaScript 2.0 can be found on the following site: http://www.ecmascript.org/</p>
        <p>Today, Netscape's JavaScript and Microsoft's JScript conform to the ECMAScript standard, although 
            both the languages still support the features that are not a part of the standard.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">JavaScript - Syntax</h3>
        <p>JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are placed within 
            the HTML tags in a web page.
        </p>
        <p>You can place the tags, containing your JavaScript, anywhere within your web page, 
            but it is normally recommended that you should keep it within the tags.
        </p>
        <p>The  tag alerts the browser program to start interpreting all the text between these tags as 
            a script. A simple syntax of your JavaScript will appear as follows.
        </p>
        <p>The script tag takes two important attributes −</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Language</b>
                    - This attribute specifies what scripting language you are using. Typically, its value 
                    will be javascript. Although recent versions of HTML (and XHTML, its successor) have 
                    phased out the use of this attribute.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Type</b>
                    - This attribute is what is now recommended to indicate the scripting language in use and 
                    its value should be set to "text/javascript".
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Whitespace and Line Breaks</h3>
        <p>JavaScript ignores spaces, tabs, and newlines that appear in JavaScript programs. You can use spaces, 
            tabs, and newlines freely in your program and you are free to format and indent your programs 
            in a neat and consistent way that makes the code easy to read and understand.
        </p>
        <h3>Semicolons are Optional</h3>
        <p>Simple statements in JavaScript are generally followed by a semicolon character, just as they 
            are in C, C++, and Java. JavaScript, however, allows you to omit this semicolon if each of your 
            statements are placed on a separate line. For example, the following code could be written without 
            semicolons.
        </p>
        <p><b>Note</b> − It is a good programming practice to use semicolons.</p>
        <h3>Case Sensitivity</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. This means that the language keywords, variables, function 
            names, and any other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.
        </p>
        <p>So the identifiers <b>Time</b> and <b>TIME</b> will convey different meanings in JavaScript.</p>
        <p><b>NOTE</b> − Care should be taken while writing variable and function names in JavaScript.</p>
        <h3>Comments in JavaScript</h3>
        <p>JavaScript supports both C-style and C++-style comments, Thus −</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                <p>Any text between a // and the end of a line is treated as a comment and is ignored by JavaScript.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Any text between the characters /* and */ is treated as a comment. This may span multiple lines.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>JavaScript also recognizes the HTML comment opening sequence JavaScript treats this as a 
                    single-line comment, just as it does the // comment.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The HTML comment closing sequence --> is not recognized by JavaScript so it should be written as //-->.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</body>
