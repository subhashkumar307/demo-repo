        <h3>What is Twitter Bootstrap?</h3>
        <p>Bootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful, mobile first front-end framework for 
            faster and easier web development. It uses HTML, CSS and Javascript.
        </p>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Bootstrap was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter. It was released as an 
            open source product in August 2011 on GitHub.
        </p>
        <h3>Bootstrap - Environment Setup</h3>
        <p>It is very easy to setup and start using Bootstrap. This chapter will explain how to download 
            and setup Bootstrap. We will also discuss the Bootstrap file structure, and demonstrate its 
            usage with an example.
        </p>
        <h3>Download Bootstrap</h3>
        <p>You can download the latest version of Bootstrap from https://getbootsp.com/. When you 
            click on this link, you will get to see a screen as below −
        </p>
        <img src="/Images/bootstrap3 img.png" style="margin-left: 200px; width: 50%;">
        <p>Here you can see two buttons −</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Download Bootstrap </b>
                    -  Clicking this, you can download the precompiled and minified versions 
                    of Bootstrap CSS, JavaScript, and fonts. No documentation or original source 
                    code files are included.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Download Source</b>
                    -  Clicking this, you can get the latest Bootstrap LESS and JavaScript source code directly from GitHub.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            If you work with Bootstrap's uncompiled source code, you need to compile the LESS files 
            to produce usable CSS files. For compiling LESS files into CSS, Bootstrap officially 
            supports only Recess, which is Twitter's CSS hinter based on less.js.
        </blockquote>
        <p>For better understanding and ease of use, we shall use precompiled version of Bootstrap 
            throughout the tutorial. As the files are complied and minified you don't have to bother 
            every time including separate files for individual functionality. At the time of writing 
            this tutorial the latest version (Bootstrap 3) was downloaded.
        </p>
        <h3>File structure</h3>
        <h5>Precompiled Bootstrap</h5>
        <p>Once the compiled version Bootstrap is downloaded, extract the ZIP file, and you will see 
            the following file/directory structure −
        </p>
        <img src="/Images/bootstrap6 img.png" style="margin-left: 200px; width: 50%;">
        <p>As you can see, there are compiled CSS and JS (bootstrap.*), as well as compiled and minified 
            CSS and JS (bootstrap.min.*). Fonts from Glyphicons are included, as it is the optional 
            Bootstrap theme.
        </p>
        <h5>Bootstrap Source Code</h5>
        <p>If you have downloaded the Bootstrap source code then the file structure would be as follows −</p>
        <img src="/Images/bootstrap5 img.png" style="margin-left: 200px; width: 50%;">
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                <p>The files under less/, js/, and fonts/ are the source code for Bootstrap CSS, JS, and 
                    icon fonts (respectively).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The dist/ folder includes everything listed in the precompiled download section above.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>docs-assets/, examples/, and all *.html files are Bootstrap documentation.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Bootstrap - Grid System</h3>
        <p>In this chapter we shall discuss the Bootstrap Grid System.</p>
        <h3>What is a Grid?</h3>
        <p>In graphic design, a grid is a structure (usually two-dimensional) made up of a series of 
            intersecting straight (vertical, horizontal) lines used to structure the content. It is 
            widely used to design layout and content structure in print design. In web design, it is 
            a very effective method to create a consistent layout rapidly and effectively using HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>To put in simple words, grids in web design organise and structure content, makes the websites 
            easy to scan and reduces the cognitive load on users.
        </p>
        <h3>What is Bootstrap Grid System?</h3>
        <p>As put by the official documentation of Bootstrap for grid system −</p>
        <p>Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 
            12 columns as the device or viewport size increases. It includes predefined classes for easy 
            layout options, as well as powerful mixins for generating more semantic layouts.
        </p>
        <p>Let us understand the above statement. Bootstrap 3 is mobile first in the sense that the code 
            for Bootstrap now starts by targeting smaller screens like mobile devices, tablets, and 
            then “expands” components and grids for larger screens such as laptops, desktops.
        </p>
        <h3>Mobile First Strategy</h3>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Content</b>
                    - Determine what is most important.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Layout</b>
                    - Design to smaller widths first.
                </p>
                <li>
                    <p>Base CSS address mobile device first; media queries address for tablet, desktops.
                     </p>
                </li>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Progressive Enhancement</b>
                     - Add elements as screen size increases.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
